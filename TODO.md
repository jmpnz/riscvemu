# TODO

* [ ] Ensure correctness with `riscv-tests` for end to end tests. 
    * [ ] We pass some tests, others fail due to unimplemented instructions

* [ ] Check timdbg blogposts, maybe write a time travel debugger (for fun lol)

* [ ] Add a better debug output, use LSColors and write a mini TUI library
